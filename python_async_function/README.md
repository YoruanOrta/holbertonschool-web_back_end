## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Tasks List
### Mandatory
1. **The basics of async**
2. **Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async**
3. **Measure the runtime**
4. **Tasks**
5. **Tasks**
